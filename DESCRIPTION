Description: A comprehensive framework for analyzing multivariate positive continuous data based on 
    the multivariate Box-Cox symmetric distributions generated by a normal scale mixture copula
    (the BCS-NSM distributions). Each margin can follow a different Box-Cox symmetric distribution,
    providing flexibility to accommodate data with different types of marginal distributions. The
    dependence within the BCS-NSM distributions is entirely described by a normal scale mixture
    copula, regardless of the marginal specifications. The package also provides tools for
    estimating and assessing goodness-of-fit in the associated class of multivariate regression
    models. This setting allows modeling d-dimensional positive continuous data as a function of
    explanatory variables.
